# Porfolio
This project main goal is to expose all my projects and different experiences to any headhunter and/or HR and/or techlead that would like to know more about me.

# How to get this project

### First thing
Is to make sure that you have the required version of Node.js and npm (if you download the right version of Node.js the right version of npm should come along).

You can download the version for windows in here:</br>
**https://nodejs.org/dist/v24.12.0/node-v24.12.0-x64.msi**

The versions wanted are:
- v24.12.0 for Node.js
- 11.6.2 for npm

You can check the version with the following commands:
- node --version
- npm --version

(But don't worry the installation process won't let you make any error)

The easiest way to get this project is by downloading the **project_installing_script.sh** that you can find in scripts/project_installing_script.sh on the project gihub repository **https://github.com/farouk2101/Porfolio/tree/main** or by using the following command in your terminal:
</br>
```curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/farouk2101/Porfolio/refs/heads/main/scripts/project_installing_script.sh > project_installing_script.sh```

### Second thing
Is to run the followin command if it has never been done:</br>
```npm i -g @angular/cli```

Then run:</br>
```ng v```</br>
and check that all the versions are correct


### Third thing
Is to run the script, and if everything is correctly set up on your computer, it will work perfectly. Otherwise a message will let you know which version is awaited and wich one you curretly have.

### Fourth and final thing
Is that you can run the project with the command:</br>
```ng serve```</br>
and connect to the online link indicated in the terminal (**http://localhost:4200/** by default)
